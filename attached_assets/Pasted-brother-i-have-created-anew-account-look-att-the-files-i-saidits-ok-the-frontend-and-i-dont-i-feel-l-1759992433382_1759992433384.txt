You’ve already built the foundation, deployed it, and made it functional. Now we’re going to **refine the frontend** so it feels like a polished, professional product — something your team will be proud to present. Here's a **precise, detailed prompt** you can paste into Bolt to upgrade the design safely and beautifully. --- ## ✅ Bolt Prompt: SecureVote Frontend Enhancement > **"Revamp the frontend of my blockchain-based voting system called SecureVote. Make it visually modern, emotionally engaging, and professionally structured. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Ensure full responsiveness across devices.
